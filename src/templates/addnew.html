        <pre>
# Base image
# Here you can either use the technology that
# you are using to crete your bot, or some base
# linux distro like "ubuntu"
FROM python:3


# Install all programs that you will
# need for your bot to run.

# The unzip program has to be present
# as it will be used to put your bot
# files in their appropriate place.
RUN apt install unzip -y


# Install your bot files.
# In this case we are using /app
# as the directory to host the bot
COPY bot.zip /app/bot.zip
RUN unzip /app/bot.zip  -d /app/


# Usually the best place to put your secret key
# is in the environment variables. This can be
# done as follows
# (Make sure you replace this with your own key)
ENV DISCORD_KEY=skljdfiowekjb20938490238ksndf



# Install dependancies of your bot
# The example installs discord, as it
# should be needed for most bots.
RUN pip install discord



# Set your base directory.
# This is where your bot will operate from.
# You should probably have this as the same
# path as where you copied the bot code.
WORKDIR /app



# Run the bot
# You can put any command you want here,
# as long as it follows the same format.
CMD ["python3", "main.py"]
